# Diffusion ASR Training (Docker Compose)

This project contains a self-contained Docker environment for training an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) diffusion model. All dependencies, code, and logs live **inside the container**, so no host mounting is required.

You can run training interactively and save metrics/loss plots as SVG images.
